# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a short learning introductory exercise to educate me, the coder, to core introductory concepts of web development such as code repositories, development pipelines, version control, and the beginning of client-facing code such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Every journey requires a first step, and this project is hopefully the first step in my twin goals of becoming a professional web developer and my own personal project of a Dungeons & Dragons monster database for aspiring Game Masters out there who wish to share their creations across multiple gaming systems.

While small and simple, this very basic website will serve as a reference in my early schooling, and hopefully, as time goes on, I'll have increasingly complex and sophisticated examples to my credit.  As it stands, this early project has taught me the very basics integrating CSS and Javascript into pages, and using Git for version control, which is something I knew of, but had absolutely no clue how to use (despite unsuccessfully trying to figure out how to work it from my experimentation).


## Installation

## Usage

This project can be used as an early reference for future assignments.  The HTML page contains a basic structure and has links to a corresponding CSS sheet and Javascript code.  If you open the page in Live Server out of Visual Studio Code, you will see how the page functions as per a user's view.  If you go further and right click and select Inspect -> Console, you will be able to see the results of the Javascript coding.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred.  (Student note: What are we now?  The developer mafia?)

Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
